# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression, a statistical machine-learning technique, to predict the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model analyzes the relationship between a binary dependent variable (survival or not) and several independent variables derived from the Titanic dataset.
